# Agentic Loan Application Workflow: Status & Gap Analysis

## Current Implementation

- **Agentic Workflow**: Orchestrates deterministic and LLM-based agents for loan application assessment.
- **Mock Tools**: All compliance and fraud tools are implemented as Python functions with mock logic, decorated for OpenAI Agents SDK.
- **Parallel Execution**: Compliance and fraud checks run concurrently using asyncio.
- **Decision Logic**: LLM-based decision agent, with fallback deterministic rules if LLM output is not structured.
- **Alerting**: Alerts are sent via a mock alert agent/tool.
- **Opik Tracing**: (If enabled) Tracing hooks are ready for Opik observability.
- **Error Handling**: Robust to LLM output errors; falls back to deterministic logic.
- **Test Scenarios**: Two example applications (clean and fraudulent) are run end-to-end.

## Missing Features / Gaps

- **MCP Integration**: All tool calls are currently mocks; no real MCP (Model Context Protocol) or external service integration. 
  - *TODOs* are present in code for future MCP replacement.
- **PDF/Markdown Parsing**: No document parsing (e.g., Docling or OpenAI tool) for application documents; only structured dict/JSON is supported.
- **Structured Output**: Agents return plain text; no enforced structured (TypedDict/Pydantic) output from LLMs.
- **Advanced Fraud/Compliance Logic**: Only basic mock rules (e.g., name in list, regex postcode check).
- **Metrics/Observability**: Metrics dict is present in state, but not populated or tracked.
- **Notebook Conversion**: Not yet converted to a Jupyter notebook; code is script-based.
- **User Interface**: No web or CLI UI; only console output.
- **Extensibility**: No plugin/extension system for new tools or agents.

## Next Steps / TODOs

1. **Integrate MCP Services**
   - Replace mock tool logic with real MCP calls for compliance, fraud, identity, etc.
2. **Add Document Parsing**
   - Integrate Docling or OpenAI PDF/Markdown parser for document_id field.
3. **Enforce Structured Output**
   - Use TypedDict or Pydantic models for agent output_type, and parse/validate LLM output.
4. **Improve Mock Logic**
   - Expand fraud/compliance rules and add more realistic test data.
5. **Populate Metrics**
   - Track timing, tool usage, and agent decisions in the metrics dict.
6. **Notebook Conversion**
   - Refactor code for Jupyter notebook compatibility (cell-based, less reliance on __main__).
7. **UI/UX**
   - (Optional) Add a simple CLI or web UI for submitting applications and viewing results.
8. **Extensibility**
   - Design for easy addition of new tools/agents (plugin pattern).
9. **Testing**
   - Add unit and integration tests for deterministic and agentic logic.
